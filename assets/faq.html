        <h3>Adding Packages</h3>
        <p>
            Packages are added by simply visiting their GoDep site.<br>
            Example: For <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">github.com/golang/dep</a> go to
            <a href="/github.com/golang/dep">godep.org/github.com/golang/dep</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you only support GitHub?</h3>
        <p>
            For now we focused on GitHub, simply because it's the most popular development platform and
            used by most Go projects.<br>
            We plan on supporting at least as many platforms as godoc.org does
        </p>

        <h3>I am missing feature X</h3>
        <p>
            In case you're missing a feature please use the
            <a href="https://github.com/metalmatze/godep.org/issues">GitHub issues</a> to open a new one, so we can discuss there.
